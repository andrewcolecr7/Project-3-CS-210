Project 3

-This project was my Project 3 for CS-210. This project tasked me with creating an application that could create and store new grocery list, lookup item counts from an existing database, save new data and create files. It can also provide you a number for all of your searches, and/or a histogram of the items that you were looking for. 

-Overall the program works pretty well without any issues that instantly come to mind.

-As far as I can tell the program works exactly as described and doesn't have an blatant errors or issues that you may run into, it loops well and the function ends when desired.

-The most challenging part of the project was definitley creating the loops as stated above and making sure the my if-else statements would cover my bases if users input incorrect information.

-This project definitley helped me sharpen all of my C++ skills and become much more knowledgable on how to create loops and it definitley was a challenge. The skills that I think will be able to transfer is just the ability to create a project without having the exact instructions or framework in front of me, being able to interpret and provide what a client wants.

-In order to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I must keep it neat and not cluttered, label the different sections of code, and make sure that my in-line comments are accurate and describe and explain what exactly the code is doing.
